## [v2.0.0] - 2025-08-13

### Added
- **üéØ SelectOption Support for Frontend Select Boxes** - Enhanced `/all` endpoints

  - Optimized database queries - only selects necessary fields
  - Alphabetically sorted results for better UX

### Changed

  - Fixed controller routes to be explicit (e.g., `/users` instead of `""`)

### Fixed
- **üõ†Ô∏è GORM Field Optimization for MySQL**
  - Added proper size tags: `email` gets `size:255;index`, `string` gets `size:255`
  - Text fields use explicit `type:text` for longer content
  - URLs get `size:512` for longer links
  - Slugs get `size:255;uniqueIndex` for unique indexing
  - Decimal fields get `type:decimal(10,2)` for proper money precision
  - Foreign keys automatically get `index` for better performance
- **üêõ Template Field Resolution**
  - Fixed template errors with missing `.StructName` ‚Üí `.Model` fields
  - Corrected `.LowerName` ‚Üí `.ModelLower` field references
  - Resolved `.PluralName` ‚Üí `.Plural` field mappings

## [v2.1.0] - 2025-08-13

### Added
- **üéØ Enhanced Swagger Documentation System** - Complete overhaul of API documentation
  - Auto-discovery of swagger annotations from controller files
  - Enhanced `base docs` command to generate comprehensive documentation  
  - Support for detailed @Param, @Success, @Failure, and @Security annotations
  - Automatic parsing of parameter types, request bodies, and responses
  - Integration with `base start -d` flag for automatic doc generation
- **üîß API Route Prefix Fix** - Unified API structure  
  - All swagger routes now correctly prefixed with `/api`
  - Updated controller templates to include `/api` prefix automatically
  - Fixed swagger documentation to match actual API structure
  - New modules automatically generate with correct API routes
- **üìã Controller Template Improvements**
  - Consolidated to single controller template (removed duplicate)
  - Enhanced swagger annotations with detailed parameter information
  - Better error handling and response schemas
  - Auto-generation includes security requirements

### Fixed
- Template generation now uses correct `/api` prefixed routes
- Swagger documentation matches actual server endpoints
- Controller generation produces consistent API structure


### Added
- **üöÄ MAJOR: Automatic Relationship Detection** - Revolutionary enhancement to code generation
  - Fields ending with `_id` and type `uint` automatically generate GORM relationships
  - Eliminates manual relationship specification - just use naming conventions!
  - Auto-generates both foreign key fields AND relationship fields
  - Includes proper GORM tags with `foreignKey` relationships
  - Works seamlessly with existing manual relationship syntax
- **Smart Field Processing**: Enhanced `ProcessField` function to detect relationship patterns
- **Template Enhancements**: Updated all templates to handle auto-detected relationships
- **Clean Code Generation**: Eliminated duplicate field generation issues
- **Major Version Upgrade Safety**: Added `--major` flag to upgrade command for controlled major version upgrades
- **Smart Upgrade Behavior**: Default `base upgrade` now only upgrades within the same major version (e.g., 1.x ‚Üí 1.y)
- **Major Version Upgrade Warning**: Added interactive warning for major version upgrades with breaking change information
- **Enhanced Version Command**: Version command now shows specific information about major version upgrades
- **Upgrade Command Documentation**: Enhanced help text with examples for both minor and major upgrades

### Changed
- **BREAKING**: Enhanced relationship detection changes code generation behavior
- **Model Template**: Updated to handle both foreign key and relationship fields from auto-detection
- **Service Template**: Fixed Create/Update methods to prevent duplicate field assignments
- **Field Processing Logic**: `ProcessField` now returns multiple fields for `_id` patterns
- **Template Consistency**: All templates now work with enhanced relationship detection

### Fixed
- **Duplicate Fields**: Resolved issue where foreign key fields were generated multiple times
- **Service Layer**: Fixed Create and Update operations to properly handle relationship fields
- **Template Logic**: Corrected template conditions to avoid conflicts between manual and auto relationships

### Migration Guide
- **Existing projects**: Continue to work without changes
- **New projects**: Can use `_id` suffix convention for automatic relationships
- **Mixed usage**: Manual relationship syntax still works alongside auto-detection

### Examples

**Code Generation - Before v2.0.0:**
```bash
base g article title:string content:text author:belongsTo:Author category:belongsTo:Category
```

**Code Generation - v2.0.0 and later:**
```bash
base g article title:string content:text author_id:uint category_id:uint
```

**Upgrade Commands:**
```bash
base upgrade         # Safe: only upgrades within current major version (1.x ‚Üí 1.y)
base upgrade --major # Allow major version upgrade (1.x ‚Üí 2.x) with breaking changes warning
```

Both generate the same result, but v2.0.0 is much simpler!

**Generated Model (both approaches):**
```go
type Article struct {
    Id         uint     `json:"id" gorm:"primarykey"`
    Title      string   `json:"title"`
    Content    string   `json:"content"`
    AuthorId   uint     `json:"author_id"`
    Author     Author   `json:"author,omitempty" gorm:"foreignKey:AuthorId"`
    CategoryId uint     `json:"category_id"`
    Category   Category `json:"category,omitempty" gorm:"foreignKey:CategoryId"`
}
```
